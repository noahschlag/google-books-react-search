I had a really hard time with this project, if I didn't have the help I do, there is no way I would be able to get all of these done with the time I have. i'm thankful to have somebody who took the class, and has done these homework assignments before, and is able to devote all of this time in helping me to make sure I am able to pass. I was unable to get the app to function, it is telling me there is a problem with the index hs inside of /develop/src/index.js, but neither I or my tutor are able to figure out exactly what the issue is regarding it
